				The following page is a hand-coded website chronicling my journey to becoming a web developer. Each blog post will be coupled with some minor or major revision to the structure and style of the website as I learn more about HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and MySQL. I'm building and learning from the ground up with the intention of applying to a coding bootcamp next year. Come join me and see how everything unfolds after the jump!

				<strong>Please note</strong> the 'About' and 'Blog' buttons are toggled using a simple CSS hack using the :target pseudo class (no JavaScript yet!) A little tacky, I realize but once I learn jQuery I will replace it!

				<h2><a href="2014/11/progress-update-001.html">Progress Update 001</a></h2>
				<h5>Saturday, November 29, 2014 &mdash; 9:29 AM</h5>
					<p>Progress updates are not happening as frequently as I thought they would be but I'm alright with that because I am still learning a lot of foundational material. I want to provide an outline of all the new material I've been learning and some of the resources I've used so far. I'm coming to terms with the fact that the more I learn the more I realize how much more I need to learn. It's a bit overwhelming but there's a light at the end of the tunnel and it's only getting brighter. Is that cheeseballs? Idk, I'm just really motivated to work work work!</p>

				<h5>Sunday, November 9, 2014 &mdash; 5:08 PM</h5>
					<p>I feel it's important to just flush everything out, everything I've been doing and everything I've learned so far that has led me to this point. This is going to be a long post and hopefully it doesn't put you to sleep. It's going to be like that longish article you buried in your bookmarks intended for a later read but now it's come back all up in your face and I'm making you eat it, but only if you want to, that is. Say noms!</p>

				<h5>Monday, September 1, 2014 &mdash; 1:37 AM</h5>
					<p>It's crazy to think that I'm actually going to attempt what I'm about to do when seven months ago, I don't think I would have even considered it: I'm going to teach myself how to develop a fully functional responsive website portfolio and a build a few web apps along the way, from the ground up, hand-coded from scratch, all in preparation for the coding bootcamps I'll be applying to next Spring. That's a pretty big deal right!? (Don't tell my I've flatlined before I even started.)</p>
