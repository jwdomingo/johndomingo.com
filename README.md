===============

johndomingo.com is my first hand-coded website. It is intended as a portfolio site and initial testing grounds for future projects.

The Scheme of Things is my blog. It traces my journey as an aspiring web developer and in it I write about the languages and technologies I am learning. I also want to chronicle my experiences, my process, and my evolution.

Follow me and find out how it all turns out!
