				The following page is a hand-coded website chronicling my journey to becoming a web developer. Each blog post will be coupled with some minor or major revision to the structure and style of the website as I learn more about HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and MySQL. I'm building and learning from the ground up with the intention of applying to a coding bootcamp next year. Come join me and see how everything unfolds after the jump!

				<strong>Please note</strong> the 'About' and 'Blog' buttons are toggled using a simple CSS hack using the :target pseudo class (no JavaScript yet!) A little tacky, I realize but once I learn jQuery I will replace it!

				<h2>Bleaching the Canvas</h2>
				<h5>Sunday, November 9, 2014 &mdash; 5:08 PM</h5>
				<p>I warned you this would be long but you've got a little masochist in you and it's going to take you far into this blog if you don't control yourself now.</p>
		
			<p>I feel it's important to just flush everything out, everything I've been doing and everything I've learned so far that has led me to this point. This is going to be a long post and hopefully it doesn't put you to sleep. It's going to be like that longish article you buried in your bookmarks intended for a later read but now it's come back all up in your face and I'm making you eat it, but only if you want to, that is. Say noms!</p>
			
			<p>Learning HTML/CSS and some cursory JS: I guess I've been at it for a month and a half now and it's reaffirming to reflect on how proactive I've been about my studies. And yet I haven't been keeping up with this blog as I promised, which is typical of every blog I've ever started so I should at least know better by now &mdash; and yet I don't so womp.</p>
			
			<p>I really have been working hard, I promise. There's just been a LOT of changes going on in my life and most of these changes have been wonderful (a few have been not so). I plan to update you about everything but first I feel we must get acquainted. Don't you think? I mean, I sort of just crawled into your browser taking up precious bandwidth with my poorly designed site and now I'm expecting you to read all about me and the trivialities of my life history blahddy blahddy blah. How presumptuous of me and I still haven't said "Hey, Hi, I'm John. What's up? What's cooking?" So rude. (I'm sorry.)</p>
			
			<p>Gah, I guess we start with my name then. I'm John Domingo and I am 24 years old. Sounds like a snooze fest, you're thinking, but let me try to convince you otherwise. It's going to get long from here so let me chunk it up for ya:</p>
			
			<h4>Where I Live</h4>
			
			<p>I'm shacked up in Dogtown, Oakland at the moment in my cozy little flea-ridden room. If you live in Oakland you know all too well about the stray cats and all the wonderful (crazy) people who love taking in stray cats. Sadly, these people forget it becomes everyone else's problem when the mew mews are up until four in the morning using their fishhooky barbed penisi (yes, penisi) to make babies. (My vocabulary rocks.) So my neighborhood is a noisy, itchy nightmare and I often turn into one grumpy cat because of it, but most times, it's the place I call home.</p>
			
			<p>I did a wonderful job selling that one there but in all honesty, I find my neighborhood to be quite lovely. It's got a strong personality kind of like that leathery musk you always find a little too pungent and yet you breathe in deep whenever it passes under your nose because there's a grandpa-ey nostalgia to it that reminds you it has to be something more. And no, I'm not saying it stinks around my block, although it probably does and I'm just used to it by now (I live near a recycling center). If you walked around these streets I think you'd see what I mean. There's an little bit of danger and yet an odd sense peace about the place that forces you take it for what it is and I think that's what gives Dogtown its unique charm. Also I'm super defensive about my neighborhood and anyone who threatens to judge the people, myself included, that inhabit it. Come visit some time. I've got plenty of itchy meds for sharing.</p>
			
			<p>My absolute favorite part about my little town is the urban community garden just a few block away. It's sponsored by City Slicker Farms and is open two days a week from 10 am to 5 pm. They sell bunches of kale for about $1 and fresh picked tomatoes of all sorts of varieties for making the lovely <a href="http://minimalistbaker.com/simple-patatas-bravas/">marinara</a> I've been obsessing about all summer. (Just replace the canned toms with fresh ones &mdash; and in all your cooking for that matter!) It's dirt cheap and just about as local as you can get around this part of Oakland. You really oughta visit.</p>

			<h4>Where I Work</h4>
			
			<p>I do the nine-to-five (to stay alive), and it's a fun little dance that I hope doesn't get too old too soon. October 14 marks my one-year and that will be a fun little benchmark. I realize this experience is just the first stepping-stone and there will be more change to come over the horizon. At this point, it should be obvious that I'm planning a major career change that will involve a 3-4 month period of unemployment in order to venture off into the (somewhat) foreign territory of Techie-Dev-dom. This change would mark a complete departure from the path I've been paving since I was a lil' old uni student, thinking that by now, I'd be sailing the oceans submerging CTDs in deep water basins. It seems that my new career prospects might be more confined to the cube life, but it's not a terribly depressing notion because I know now more than ever that nothing is ever set in stone. So while I feel like I've exhausted this current stepping stone, I know there is still much to learn in the next few months before I leave. There are a few more projects I want to see completed and more than anything, I want to leave this company better than when I came to it.</p>
			
			<p>By the freaking way, I should mention before we go on further that I am a terrible writer and love run-on sentences. The only valid literary style I can consistently follow is stream of consciousness so do beware. But to be a little more serious, this blog is all about personal development and I think that my writing ability can only improve the more I practice. So now you're going to have to start tracking my tone and voice in addition to my style and semantics if you really want the full picture of my personal growth. Laugh out loud.</p>
			
			<h4>What I Do</h4>
			
			<p>I work in a geology lab that provides testing services for hazardous materials. Yes I'm constantly breathing in deadly things but nothing above the permissible exposure limits. Like any laboratory (I hope), ours requires a robust database&mdash;or rather databases&mdash;to manage information (i.e., processing and generating lab reports); quality control management (to make sure the results we're generating aren't just glooping out of our you know whats); customer relationship management (because we're a business and we obvi need loyal clients to make munnies); and every other workplace-related database we try to meticulously manage (i.e., inventory, accounting, et al.)</p>
			
			<p>Anywho, my job is to administer the major databases as well as help improve efficiency in the minor ones. More and more, I'm focusing soley on our LIMS (laboratory information management system) as well as this multi-million QC/QA database project for our largest client. It's a crazy endeavor but it's also my first real "program consulting" experience (if that's what you would call it) so it offers exciting plot twists every now and then, forcing me to question what's left of my sanity. I'm starting to get restless here because the type of programming I do cannot fully tap into the creative process I constantly seek. As an aspiring developer, I feel that a constant creative nurturing is crucial to my learning and I'm probably not going to get too much of that as a DBA. I should probably mention I work with a database originally built for Commodore 64 (LOL the irony) and everything I know about database management has been learned on the job, for the job. Because of the circumstances, I feel stuck and that is the last thing I want to feel or be in any job position.</p>
			
			<p>I feel stuck because I don't know enough about more modern or more practical databases so my resume would be rather stunted in a competitive sense. At least this is what I think is my current situation. When I look for other DBA positions, there are usually much stronger emphases on technologies that I am not fully comfortable with but I know I can learn these on the job just like I did when I first started my current position. However I want to make sure that in my next line of work, whatever I may be doing, I won't have to have to learn all the basics (completely) on my own, and on the job. I realize that web development is sort of exactly that (oxymoron?). Devs learn every day as they adopt new frameworks and languages into their repertoire and obviously they're always learn from others in the community. However, that has not been my experience thus far so it's hard to marry my experiences with my expectations. No one has provided me with best practices in my current trade and I feel like I don't have any because of that. There's been a serious missed opportunity because I haven't had a strong mentor and I regret not actively seeking one even if it was outside of work.</p>
			
			<p>I think the one thing to take away from this post is how I got this job and what I've done since. I applied to be a lab analyst but was way under-qualified. Yet they saw something in my resume that was enough for my supervisors to create a marketing-intern-slash-database-programmer position for me. Fresh out of school and no formal CS degree, I just had to jump at the opportunity because I didn't know if there would ever be anything like it for me. And at that moment my career path took a completely drastic turn that has led me to where I'm at today. I now realize this passion I've had for technology can actually be a practical and viable career. And don't ask why I didn't think that before because maybe in the back of my head it was obvious that problem solving using computer technologies == the most practical job prospect, but the reality was that I never thought I could do it or catch up fast enough to make it a serious gig.</p>
			
			<p>And now here I am with this duh-moment realization that heck, I've got all the time in the world and if I'm not using it to catch up, I'm not using it. So long story short, I'm going to freakin use it.</p>
			
			<h4>Where I Work Out (Actually Relevant)</h4>
			
			<p>Some heartbreaky stuff happened a while back (actually all year long.. what's up with that Cancer??) where I was dumped twice, was too young/immature (twice), and just a lot of other really sour relationship attempts, and I thought heck, I'm entitled to a quarter life crisis right? So I started Olympic weight-lifting. Well it instantly became something less reactionary and more to do with me loving me. I am starting to see body image in a completely new light and less as something that I should take for granted. I'm learning that physical strength follows after mental strength and I strongly believe that I am able to let in so much change in my life right now because of what I'm learning through CrossFit. The new friends are great (and all hot) so that helps a lot but overall, with ex-marines yelling at me to do as many reps as I can do on the minute, every minute, it's becoming one of the most relaxing parts of my day.</p>
			
			<h4>What I Eat (Irrelevant?)</h4>
			
			<p>I've been a flexitarian (lacto-ovo vegetarian who makes exception for gelatin because I am weak for the gummies) since 2009 (but gummies since circa 1996). I'm afraid my consciousness about the matter has flatlined in the past year and I regret not engaging in my food politics more frequently. But I think it has to do more with the social circles I currently surround myself and while it's not their fault, I've become more lenient about what conversations are held at the dinner table (right now it's almost exclusively gossip, lol). I will work on it I promise, and hopefully integrate it into this site somehow. I've got a few ideas.
			
			<p>I guess I should also plug in herbal teas I started drinking recently to help me get a better night's sleep. This is a part of my health I've paid very little attention to even though I've known for a while my moods and energy are directly linked to my lack of good sleep. I am making a more consistent effort to get enough sleep (7-8 hours), and also making time every morning to have a hearty breakfast. These two changes have dramatically impacted my well being in the past few weeks and coupled with CrossFit, I don't think I've ever felt any better. Wanna be health buddies? Get at me.</p>
			
			<h4>The People I Love</h4>
			
			<p>This is probably the most difficult subject for me to talk about right now because I'm not in the right head space I guess. But I do want to say I love my family very much and all this time away from you all has been one of the most challenging things I've ever gone through despite that I don't show it at all. In a lot of the things I do, in order to better myself and improve my circumstances, I am always thinking about everyone back at home and I hope at the end of the day or week or month that you don't hear from me, I hope you all know I still love you very much.</p>
			
			<h4>Why It's All Relevant</h4>
			
			<p>I needed to write this. I needed to put as much of myself out there before I attempted to bleach the canvas. Eck, that sounds pretty self-destructive, I realize, but I promise there's more beauty to the metaphor if you let me explain. Also if you've read this far, might as well get to the end right?</p>
			
			<p>I've never taken the time to trace any type of personal growth I've undergone despite that I'm aware of how much I'm changing every day. (Wait, does Instagram count because I guess I kind of do it then..) What I've noticed is that it takes a few years down the road before I can glance back and not be able to recognize myself. That's when I really know I've become someone else and it's in those moments I sort of regret not preserving parts of the old me to remember by. So I'm taking a more proactive approach this time and using this medium as a tracker I can be accountable to. Everything I've written in this post is a snapshot of my current being and it was all worth mentioning because these are the parts of my life, I believe, will be the most vulnerable to change. A year from now, when I become a web developer and I immerse myself in a completely new professional community, I don't know how much of this current part of me I'll still retain. I don't know if I will still love my neighborhood as much as I do at this moment. I don't know if I will still tread with caution when I move into a new town or if I will be the force of gentrification that plagues it. I don't know what relationships I will still have and who will still be in my life. I don't know what kind of progress I make in my health and fitness endeavors. I don't know because it's impossible to know. But (and here comes the cliché butt) I do know that what I've written here comes from a genuine place of happiness, and youthfulness, and transition despite all the failures and heartbreaks I'm also going through. And it's a reminder that I'm working towards attaining peace in my convictions and contentment with all my choices in this life and the next.</p>
			
			<p>This is the painting I'm working on here. Changes in my life will act to white out parts of the canvas. If I'm an active player in these changes, I can maintain what parts of the canvas are salvaged and what parts can be used as new space. Yes I could have just said something along the lines of I'm starting from scratch, building from the ground up, out with the old, in with the new, blah blah blah, but the bleachy bits I'm going for here are more aligned with what I'm hoping to convey. The entire image is not clear yet and it's not going to be any time soon. Change is scary and it can sting like a muh fuh but it forces you to step back and smell the bleach. Perhaps it would all make sense if I could see the canvas in the grander scheme of things but for now I'm going to keep on painting and bleaching and painting until I get there.</p>
