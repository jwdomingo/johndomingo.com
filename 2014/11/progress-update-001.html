				The following page is a hand-coded website chronicling my journey to becoming a web developer. Each blog post will be coupled with some minor or major revision to the structure and style of the website as I learn more about HTML/CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and MySQL. I'm building and learning from the ground up with the intention of applying to a coding bootcamp next year. Come join me and see how everything unfolds after the jump!

				<h2>Progress Update 001</h2>
				<h5>Saturday, November 29, 2014 &mdash; 9:29 AM</h5>
				<p>Progress updates are not happening as frequently as I thought they would be but I'm alright with that because I'm still learning a lot of foundational material. I'm coming to terms with the reality that the more I learn, the more I realize how much more I need to learn! It's a bit overwhelming but there's a light at the end of this very long tunnel and it's only getting brighter. Is that cheeseballs? Idk, I'm just really motivated to work work work!</p>
				
				<p>This is going to be another long post and it's definitely more for me to binge self-reflect but if you're bored or curious then, hey, read on. I know I promised (did I?) last post that I wouldn't be posting mini-memoirs on here but just bear with me until I develop my blogging style and hone my writing skills. That will probably take a while.</p>
				
				<h4>Let's start at the beginning</h4>
				<p>I guess this this whole idea of becoming a web developer started back in January when my friend Kathleen and I were having our annual, lol, happy hour at <a href="http://www.tropisueno.com/" target="_blank">Tropisue&ntilde;o</a> in SOMA (yummy margaritas!). I was trying to lay out what I thought was the best way for me to get a job at Google, lol, and I was raving about how Harvard Extension School was the yellow brick road I needed to follow. My idea was that I could take online courses toward a Masters degree in information technology while remaining in the workforce so that I could continue to gain industry experience (but mostly so I could afford to live in the Bay).</p>
				
				<p>I think the tuition would have been around &#36;23K and it would have taken me 2-3 years to complete the program but it seemed so worth it at the time despite that I guess I didn't really know what it all meant (i.e., what it meant to be a software engineer) and quite honestly, I still don't. Nonetheless, I began saving up for my first extension course, which was about &#36;2.5K but with my salary, meeting the Fall 2014 semester did not seem feasible. Kathleen suggested I look into <a href="http://appacademy.io" target="_blank">App Academy</a> and I remember my ears perking up when she started telling me about coding bootcamps and how this particular one had no upfront tuition until post-job placement.</p>
				
				<p>I don't want to assume anything about my readers (if you exist, hi!!) so I'll add some commentary here on <a href="http://www.skilledup.com/articles/the-ultimate-guide-to-coding-bootcamps-the-exhaustive-list/" target="_blank">coding bootcamps</a>: Essentially, bootcamps are accelerated computer programming schools designed to jumpstart fledgling hackers as full-stack web developers in a matter of weeks. In contrast to a more traditional four-year trajectory, a three-month bootcamp emphasizes the industry standard tools one would need to land a career in software engineering. One of the main ideas is that folks will gain their most valuable experiences on the job anyway so why not get them ready to be at that point now?</p>
				
				<p>The big selling point here is that bootcamps teach you just what you need to know to become a junior developer without the added burden of final exams and essays and four years of your life without any solid income. The focus is on building your portfolio projects, not maintaining your GPA. It's so clear now that is going to be my path but it took me all year to come to that conclusion <span>(with the help of friends and family giving me advice based on what they knew about me and not what they didn't know about me as a programmer, and I think that was actually the most helpful thing).</span></p>
				
				<h4>And now a digression to explain what I eventually chose</h4>
				
				<p>In the spring, I took an assignment-based online course on database management using Microsoft Access 2010 at Berkeley City College. I immediately applied the new concepts I learned to my job and although it wasn't my intention to take this course for work, it had this profoundly synergistic effect on my database programming skills. Once I knew more about database theory, my coding and refactoring feats at work were suddenly enumerable and I was soon self-promoted to database administrator.</p>
				
				<p>Haha, I say "self-promoted" because I essentially took on a larger role that wasn't technically in my job description and I don't think my boss even thought I could handle it. He was surprised to find out I had already been changing some of the UX holes in our database after I spoke with folks around the lab about their data entry experiences. I stepped out of my more data entry/analysis role and into a more database management/administrator role that focused on QA/QC processes and needs analyses to help make our lab workflows more accurate, efficient, and productive.</p>
				
				<p>Eventually, as I continued to practice VBA programming on the side, I was informally inducted as a programming consultant for our largest client, an engineering firm that welcomed a data scientist from our lab to finally complete the multi-million dollar project they'd been collaborating on for the past two (or more?) years.</p>
				
				<p>The main thing to note here is how much I was able to teach myself on the job after I learned more about database theory. This made me question how important it is to build foundational knowledge&mdash;like the kind you spend four years learning at a university just to end up diving into the deep doo doo pool of student debt. I'm diminishing all the other great experiences that came out of college <span>(although there were some pretty bad times that continued to haunt my dreams until just recently, like dreams where you realize you signed up for a class that you haven't been to all semester and it's already the week before finals... I swear, I think I lived that reality my freshman year but the details are so hazy now and probably for the better) (ah, by the way, did I mention in my second post that my style of writing is more like a stream of consciousness?? good luck to you!).</span> Well I might as well just kill that sentence. Done. Okay, I might as well start a new paragraph too now right?</p>
				
				<p>So I'm diminishing the experience of college to make the point (wait, I'm trying to make points now??) that understanding computer science theory will probably get me further in my career as a software engineer, especially if I'm creeping in as web designer &rarr; web developer &rarr; software developer. Perhaps a shortcut like a bootcamp will hurt me in the long run if I don't take the time to understand how all the pieces fit in the grand scheme of things (corny, I know) buuut at the same time, there is a reality I live in where I have this burning anxiety to get somewhere now and make something of my life NOW. There is way too much to learn and I have too many interests to feed that I just need to make smart decisions and prioritize.</p>
				
				<p>I wouldn't say that I'm impatient, although I probably am <span>*insert some pensive self-reflection here but spare it for the reader's sake*</span> but there are just circumstances in my life that I feel I can't fully surmount without a change in career. And a change in career requires this new skillset that I'm not even 100% confident in yet. There is so much I still need to learn, I've barely just started scratching the surface of JavaScript! Maybe it's too much to expect myself to know the basics of a full stack this early on in my journey but I like to think I'm determined enough to make this work and I've put in so much work that it just has to.</p>
				
				<p>And so I've decided I am going to apply for a coding bootcamp next year. I would like to apply in January in order to start in February or March. Of course that means I am going to be jobless, penniless, social-lifeless very soon since the new year really isn't that far away (gasp!!!). I plan to maintain my health and my I will still be there for my friends but hopefully they will understand if I end up needing a three-month hiatus from any socializing.</p>
				
				<p>For now, I just have to keep going like a little pink bunny, pacing myself to the beat of my own drum. At times I feel like I'm making great strides and then other times I fall into a rut of insecurity knowing how much more there is to learn. Don't worry though, this is only Post No. 3 and I'm not throwing the towel in yet! Well, I guess I'm not throwing in the towel at all, like ever, because, I mean, this is some pretty serious business here and I'm very focused on what I need to do and need to accomplish. There's definitely no room for any thought of quitting, not when I've been so consistent about my progress. So the next post will be about that: An actual progress update of things I've done since January and what more I need to do before I can start applying to a coding school.</p>
				
				<p>Until next time!</p>
